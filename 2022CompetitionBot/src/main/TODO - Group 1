Create 2 new subsystems:
    1. ShooterSub   (or ShootSub?)
    2. ClimbSub     (or ClimberSub?)

    Steps:
        - create new subsystem:
            - fill in header include file:
                - what actions need to be performed?
                    => define public methods
                - what motors/solenoids will be used? what kinds? how many?
                    => define private member variables
            - fill in CPP code file:
                => implement methods making use of member variables
        - identify what actions may need to be performed on the joystick:
            - do we have subsystem methods to support each?
            - create new commands:
                => hook up to subsystem and joystick
                => fill in Execute implementation
