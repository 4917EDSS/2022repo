        Create 2 new subsystems:
DONE        => ShooterSub
DONE        => ClimberSub

            Steps:
                - create new subsystem:
                    - fill in header include file:
                        - what actions need to be performed?
DONE                        => define public methods
                        - what motors/solenoids will be used? what kinds? how many?
DONE                        => define private member variables
                    - fill in CPP code file:
DONE                    => implement methods making use of member variables
                - identify what actions may need to be performed on the joystick:
                    - do we have subsystem methods to support each?
                    - create new commands:
TODO                    => hook up to subsystem and joystick
TODO                    => fill in Execute implementation
